In my atm.rb get_highest_banknote method I'm trying to convert banknotes hash from yaml file into one array.
Keys(means the banknote) puts un array in amount of values.
for ex: 500=>0, 100=>
It must create the array with following elements: [100,100]
So, if client entered current amount, it wiil start to pick suitable banknotes from the index[0] till the result.
